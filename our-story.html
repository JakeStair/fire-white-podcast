            <h1>Our Love for the Game: The Story Behind the Podcast</h1>
            <p class="intro-p">
                The love for the game of basketball runs deep with me. Growing up as a small child in the '90s, reaching a mature-enough level of understanding when the Bulls were perenially beating the Utah Jazz in the Finals, the upcoming San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers decades-long reign, and the beginning of the WNBA.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="intro-p">
                Even with the WNBA starting 1997, I wasn't able to see the significance of the league. Not until that first dunk by Lisa Leslie in 2002. But before, and even after, it was the Women's College game that stuck with me. A few names are synonymous with the game for me: Pat Summitt, Geno Auriemma, Tara VanderVeer, and Vivian Stringer. These were larger-than-life giants for me. Then and now, they brought something to the game that was special, and indisputable.</p>
